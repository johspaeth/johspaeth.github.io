      <description>Synchronized Pushdown Systems (SPDS) are a recently development for efficient and precise data-flow analysis. SPDS relies on two pushdown systems, one system models field-sensitivity, the other one context-sensitivity. The results of both systems are then synchronized and yield a field- and context-sensitive data-flow analysis.
The implementation of SPDS is found here:

      <description>Boomerang is an efficient and precise demand-driven pointer analysis for Java. It achieves efficiency by propagating pointer relations in a distributive manner. For more details see our ECOOP2016 publication on Boomerang.
We recently redesigned Boomerang based on Synchronized Pushdown Systems (SPDS). SPDS are an efficient replace for $k$-limited access paths or access graphs, the original heap model Boomerang relied on.
The implementation based on SPDS is found here.

The old implementation is found here.</description>
